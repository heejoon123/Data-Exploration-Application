# Linear Regression

The statistical calculation created for exploration of association was set so that the user could set a very basic linear regression based on the **lm()** function of R. The application takes in one independent feature and one dependent feature for the calculation. This is a simple and easy linear regression and the user gets to look at the output that R typically generates from the **summary()** function of the **lm()** output. 

Documentation for the mentioned R functions are provided in the links below:
