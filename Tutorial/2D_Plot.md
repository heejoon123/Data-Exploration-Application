# How to use the 2D Plots Tab of dAbLication

The 2D Plots are to specifically generate the following plots that are held within their own sub-tab:

* A generic scatterplot
* A scatterplot with categorical data as colors/hues
* Jitterplot 
* Boxplot
* Histogram
* Violin Plot

Each sub-tab will be explained more in-detail in the following. 

### Scatterplot

Click on the **2D Plots** tab, and then go to the **scatterplots** sub-tab. There, the user has the option to choose which feature to plot as the independent and dependent features. The plot also calculates for the slope and y-intercept values. It also calculates for the Pearson correlation value and gets outputted.
