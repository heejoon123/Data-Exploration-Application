Welcome to the dAbLication repository. This repository holds the tool that could be utilized for data visualization of various types for researchers in the aim to make it similar to GraphPad's Prism tool. The dAbLication requires less data loading as it only requires the user to load the data file of interest once and no copy and pasting! 

The following information in this particular README file is for a general summary of what each feature of the application does. For more specific information, please refer to the tutorials folder and look at the file explanation of interest. 

## Data Tab:

Currently within the Data tab of this application, there are two sub-tabs where the first is the very first step of using this tool, loading in the data file. The second sub-tab is taking that loaded file and looking at specific columns of interest and potentially downloading that sub-data as a csv file into a local folder.
