# Standard Colors for Plots:

There are a lot of colors available for the 2D Plot feature of this program. But this file was generated to just list some fun colors available for the colourInput() part for users. Otherwise, this file can be used to just plot something in a specific color as the codes for colors in R are used using the specific Hex Color Codes. 

The more standard plot colors have been posted below and have come from [R's Scientific Journal and Sci-Fi Themed
Color Palettes for ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsci/vignettes/ggsci.html).
